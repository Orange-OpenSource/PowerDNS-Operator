# Contributors guide

**Want to contribute?**
We try to make it easy, and all contributions, even the smaller ones, are more than welcome.
This includes bug reports, fixes, documentation, examples...
But first, read this page (including the small print at the end).

Contributions are available on https://github.com/powerdns-operator/PowerDNS-Operator

## Legal

All original contributions to _PowerDNS-Operator_ are licensed under the
[Apache License 2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html),

All contributions are subject to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO).
The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project.
The DCO text is also included verbatim in the [DCO.txt](DCO.txt) file in the root directory of the repository.

Contributors **must** _sign-off_ that they adhere to these requirements by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to commit messages, as shown below:

```text
This is the commit message

Signed-off-by: Joe Dev <joe.dev@developer.example.org>
```

Git has a handy [`-s` command line option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) to append this automatically to your commit message:

```bash
$ git commit -s -m 'This is the commit message'
```

## Reporting an issue

This project uses Github issues to manage the issues.

Before creating an issue:

1. upgrade the operator to the latest supported release version, and check whether your bug is still present,
2. ensure the operator version is supported by the PowerDNS version you are using,
3. have a look in the opened issues if your problem is already known/tracked, and possibly contribute to the thread with your own information.

If none of the above was met, open an issue directly in Github, select the appropriate issue template and fill-in each section when applicable.

### Workflow

All submissions, including submissions by project members, need to be reviewed before being merged.

To contribute:

1. Create an issue describing the bug or enhancement you want to propose (select the right issue template).
2. Make sure the issue has been reviewed and agreed.
3. Create a pull Request, from your **own** fork (see [forking workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) documentation).
   Don't hesitate to mark yourPMR as `Draft` as long as you think it's not ready to be reviewed.
